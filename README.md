## Introduction
This project is simple but very usefull app called Student Data Manager. This app uses Python's Tkinter library for the GUI and for data visualization i used Matplotlib. The main purpose of this app is for the users to manage students marks and easy way. The app contains few features where the user can add the student name and mark and then search for specific student using their name. Sorting can be done in this app as well based on the students marks in descending order. Lastly, it visualize the data and creates a bar chart. The GUI is styled to be basic yet appealing using custom fonts and colour. All of the above features are built with error handling which means even if the users puts in the incorect type of data, the app will tell the user user its an error and enter the correct data. This project has simple programming concepts like functions, error handling, data structures eg. (lists and dictionaries), GUI design, and basic data visualization all in one simple app.

## Installation
To run this Student Data Manager app, you need Python, and the libraries Tkinter and Matplotlib. Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python. To install Matplotlib, use the following command in your terminal:

pip install matplotlib

## How to use
- Enter Student Name and Marks:

Type the student's name and their marks in the input fields at the top of the app.

### Running the app
This app requires only a single file, main.py. It can be opened and run in two ways:

- Using a Compiler:

Open the main.py file in your preferred Python compiler and press the Run button to start the app.

- Using the Terminal:
  
Alternatively, you can run the app directly from the terminal by navigating to the directory where main.py is located.  For example: 

python "C:/Users/samia/OneDrive/Desktop/Python Project/main.py"


## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:

- Tkinter:

Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the app. It provides the interactive elements like buttons, input fields, and labels.

- Matplotlib:

Used for visualizing student marks in a bar chart format. It helps create clear, graphical representations of the student data for easy comparison.

## Project Structure
- `ErrorHandling/`: Contains classes for handling various errors.
