## Introduction
This project is simple but very usefull app called Student Data Manager. This app uses Python's Tkinter library for the GUI and for data visualization i used Matplotlib. The main purpose of this app is for the users to manage students marks and easy way. The app contains few features where the user can add the student name and mark and then search for specific student using their name. Sorting can be done in this app as well based on the students marks in descending order. Lastly, it visualize the data and creates a bar chart. The GUI is styled to be basic yet appealing using custom fonts and colour. All of the above features are built with error handling which means even if the users puts in the incorect type of data, the app will tell the user user its an error and enter the correct data. This project has simple programming concepts like functions, error handling, data structures eg. (lists and dictionaries), GUI design, and basic data visualization all in one simple app.
